# Discovery Upload App

This is a dedicated upload application for the Discovery platform, built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and React Native.

## Purpose

This app allows administrators to upload event flyers and images to the Discovery platform. It automatically extracts event information from uploaded images and updates the event database.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Select and upload images from device gallery
- **Information Extraction**: Automatic extraction of event details from uploaded images
- **Context Addition**: Optional text context for uploaded images
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging and user feedback

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
